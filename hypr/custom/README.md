# Custom Hyprland Configuration

Place your custom Hyprland configurations here. These will override the defaults.

Example files you can create:
- `keybinds.conf` - Custom keybindings
- `rules.conf` - Window rules
- `env.conf` - Environment variables
- `general.conf` - General settings
- `execs.conf` - Startup programs

These files are sourced after the default configurations.
