# Zen Browser flags (Firefox-based flags only)

# For Wayland support, use environment variable MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 instead

# Note: Most of the previous flags were Chromium-specific and not compatible
# with Zen/Firefox. Zen browser accepts very few command-line flags.
# For smooth scrolling and other features, use about:config preferences instead.
